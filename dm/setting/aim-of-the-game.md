# Aim of the game (or what the players should aim for)

The players can end the game in various ways, but the main focus should be **finding and killing** the [Lich](./characters/lich.md).

The game consist of multiple intended [endings](../gameplay/endings.md), but being a TTRPG, it can end however the DM sees fit given the actions of the players.
