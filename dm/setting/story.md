# Story

In the far corner of the lands there is a small village that gives home to a few amount of people. It is a peaceful town with friendly folks.

However one day a strange, hooded figure came to the village seeking refuge. He claimed to be a lost adventurer, seeking a place to stay for the next few days. The real alias of this person is the [Apostle](./characters/apostle.md). He came from a far land with an [artifact](./items/artifact.md). This artifact was a powerful magic item that contained a demon within. This demon was the [Lich](./characters/lich.md).

The Apostle convinced the townsfolk to open the artifact and the Lich got loose. They took over peoples minds and promised the Apostle world domination at their side. However, the Lich lied to him, as the Lich is lowly monster, their only goal is to feed on the fear of others. They trapped the whole village with their mind control and forced the Apostle to work for them. They put the village under an unbreakable spell, everyone who attempts to leave the town, will eventually end up at the gates of it again. The Lich forced the Aposle to kill the mayor and take his place. His task was to lure adventurers into the town. The Lich would then erase the memories of the adventurers and make the wake up on a sunny day. Beginning the never ending nightmare...

The Apostle (posing as the mayor) gives tasks to the adventurers to make up for the mess they made. From this point forward, the [timeline]() starts and the players start the game, doing everything they can to achieve their [goal](aim-of-the-game.md). The game will end whatever the players do, if their [PANIC]() gauge fills up.
