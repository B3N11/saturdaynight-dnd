# The Children (orphans)

## Lore

There is an [Orphanage](../places/orphanage.md) at the top right of the town. This Orphanages gives home to some children. The children are all supervised by the [Orphan Keeper](orphan-keeper.md).

The twist is, there never was an orphanage in the town. At least not before the [Lich](lich.md) arrived. The house was an old tavern for bypassers and adventurers (more of a motel than a bar). After the Lich arrived, it turned the maid into an orphan keeper (or at least plays her as one).

The children in the orphanage are previous adventurers, victims of the Lich and the [Apostle](apostle.md). They were lured into the village, caught by the Lich's spell and they didn't manage to kill the Lich in time. They have gone mad from all the horrors the Lich has showed them and the Lich was able to forever curse them.

The Lich is sadistic and uses the children in 3 different ways:

- **AS LIVING BATTERIES:** Although transformed, the Lich cursed the adventurers in a way that they remained conscious. They think they are their former child selves without any of their memories. The Lich controls the orphan keeper to keep the children on a short leash and scare them at night. This allows the Lich to feed on the fear of the children when no active adventurers are present in the village and the Apostle is looking for new ones.
- **AS SCARE FACTOR:** The children do what the orphan keeper tells them. They are cursed forever and are tasked with haunting the players at night if they enter the orphanage increasing their [PANIC](../../gameplay/panic.md) meter.
- **AS GUARDIANS:** The Lich gathers powerful magical artifacts to make themselves even stronger. The previously collected artifacts (that previous groups collected for them) are stored in the basement of the orphanage. Every night, one of the children is guarding the treasure chests in the basement.

The Lich's curse is powerful, but keeping the cursed adventurers conscious comes with a price. The children's memories sometimes come back to them in blurry images. All of them write diaries where they describe their memories as dreams. From the diaries, their names and some of their memories can be recovered.

At the arrival of the players, there are 5 children in the orphanage:

- Lucy
- Tilda
- Byorn
- Piatra
- Favian

## Personality

### Day

- Shy and not talkative. They act distant and won't engage in conversation
- They will play outside of the orphanage sometimes
- If the players talk to them, they will try to go away
- They are too afraid to talk about their diaries but if the player confronts them about it, they will eventually suggest that it contains their dreams

### Night

- All the children are asleep in their rooms and cannot be waken up
- The one children that is guarding is in the basement and will attack immediately when spots the player

## Gameplay

- The children cannot be confronted. If done so, only the one guarding
- They cannot be killed, only incapacitated
- They will stop guarding their chests if the orphan keeper is killed, but the chests will be locked forever (except the one that is open at the night the orphan keeper is killed)

If the children are confronted while guarding and it can touch the player, it will put a curse on the player depending on which children it is.

> The cursed player is instantly teleported back to the Central Tree and receives `2d4+5` damage. The player receives `medium` ammount of PANIC.

#### Lucy's curse (Lustaság Átka / Curse of the Sloth)

Player must succeed a `DC 14 CONST Saving Throw` `twice` every day to stay awake. If failed, the player falls asleep for `3 hours` or can decide to take `1d6+2` damage instead. If the player falls asleep, they cant sleep well due to nightmares, it doesn't count as a short rest.
