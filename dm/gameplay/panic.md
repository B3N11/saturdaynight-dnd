# The PANIC gauge

The PANIC gauge is a custom mechanic that puts extra pressure on the players. Every player has the same amount of maximum PANIC. Since the game is heavily focused on finding out the mysteries of the village at night, every strange occurance and terrifying thing the players witness adds to the PANIC meter.

> If the PANIC meter is filled and it stays that way until morning, the player disappears and all the party members will assume they have killed themselves. In reality, they will be turned into a [child](../setting/characters/children.md).

The capacity of the PANIC gauge must be specified by the DM. It is recommended to set it to a level that the players are able to explore some of the village at night but keep in mind, that with every day, the PANIC meter goes up by a large margin.
