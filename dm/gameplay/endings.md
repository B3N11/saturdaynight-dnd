# The (intended) endings of the game

The game can end in basically any way as the DM sees fit, but the story is only fully finished if one of the following (or something similar) happens.

### Players kill the Lich

> **HowToAchieve:** The players must turn the Apostle to their side. This way, he will tell the players about the artifact and its location. After knocking the Lich out at the end of the fight, players must lock the Lich into the artifact and destroy the artifact afterwards.

If the players kill the Lich, the game is over. However, depending on how they killed it, the ending might take a different path. If the players kill the Lich using the laser in the last area, all the people the Lich controls will die as well. The so called "good ending" is when they kill the Lich without the lasers. They can use them to hurt the Lich but not to end it.

### Players stay in the village for too long and go mad

> **HowToAchieve:** If the players don't manage to find and kill the Lich before the required number of days, the players will go insane thanks to their [PANIC](panic.md) meter filling up.
